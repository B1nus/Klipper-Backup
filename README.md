# Klipper-Backup ðŸ’¾
Klipper-Backup is a fork of [klipper-backup](https://github.com/Staubgeborener/klipper-backup) with one minor difference, it does not remove any files from the remote. This means that you can have other stuff in your backup repository. This was useful for my [minitron project](https://github.com/B1nus/minitron).

## Installation
Check out [klipper-backup](https://github.com/Staubgeborener/klipper-backup?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
