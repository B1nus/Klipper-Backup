# Klipper-Backup ðŸ’¾
Klipper-Backup is a script for manual or automated GitHub backups. It's Lightweight, pragmatic and comfortable.

## RTFM
I would suggest reading the [docs](https://staubgeborener.github.io/klipper-backup), as this provides detailed step-by-step instructions and further tips.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have already used the script before release 1.0, please read [this docs section](https://staubgeborener.github.io/klipper-backup/migration) before opening an issue!

## YouTube
[Minimal 3DP](https://github.com/minimal3dp) has created a video about the initial setup and use of Klipper-Backup and made it available on YouTube. This and the wiki should explain many questions in advance.
